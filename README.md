# BUFFER ANALYSIS
[The project involved designing a 3-stage inverter chain (buffer) with a focus on optimizing its performance parameters. Initially, sizing parameters were determined using the Monte Carlo Method to introduce randomness in simulations. Simulations were conducted to evaluate energy consumption and rise/fall delays of the inverter chain. Subsequently, an optimization phase employed an algorithm from the SciPy library in Python to optimize circuit sizing factors based on an objective function representing energy consumption and constraints derived from delay models. The optimized values were then used in simulations to assess delay and energy parameters of the circuit. Comparative analysis was conducted between Monte Carlo Method results and Pareto optimal curves derived from optimization and simulation processes. These analyses were performed using LTspice for hardware description and Python with the PyLTspice library for simulations and calculations. Additionally, similar optimization procedures were implemented using the fmincon optimization algorithm in MATLAB.]
